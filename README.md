# ToDoList

Elements of To-Do List app in order:

<li>*Allow user to create daily, weekly, monthly, or even yearly minimums in terms of productivity</li>
*Record whether or not goals were completed within the time frame alloted by the user
*Use data to populate a graph to show your consistency of task completion over time
*Create an option to record daily moods, and possibly an option to explain the context of each mood in short
*Create a mechanism that reminds you of goals periodically to make sure you're on-task, by e-mail or text, or whatever would be most effective
*Ask user if they would like to challenge themselves to something new if they are consistently attaining their goals over a certain period of time
